# Python-Tutorial
Python tutorial I am creating for my family as we're homeschooling through COVID-19

Here are quick links for my kids:

Ben    | [Branch](https://github.com/pauldria/Python-Tutorial/tree/Ben)    | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Pauldria/Python-Tutorial/Ben)

## Getting Started - Binder
You can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org) to open these notebooks and execute them. Note that this is a read-only situation and you'll need to do manual work to reflect changes back to the repo.

## Getting Started - Local Machine
Your best bet is to install [JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) on your machine. Note you will first need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) first.
